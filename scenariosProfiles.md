**RCP26**

This scenario requires that carbon dioxide levels will decline to zero by 2100, starting in 2020. It is likely to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100.

**RCP45**

This scenario requires that by 2100, carbon dioxide levels will be half of that in 2050, starting to decline in 2045. It is likely keep global temperature rise 2-3 degrees Celsius by 2100. Many organisms will be unable to survive in environments from this and future scenarios (like RCP60 and RCP85 in this model).

**RCP60**

This scenario requires that carbon dioxide levels start declining in 2080, and is likely to keep global temperature rise 3-4 degrees Celsius by 2100.

**RCP85**

This scenario requires that carbon dioxide levels continue to rise through 2100. It is deemed the "worst-case" scenario.
